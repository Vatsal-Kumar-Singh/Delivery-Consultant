# AI Delivery Delay Predictor

Lightweight, local Streamlit app to predict delivery delays, generate prioritized corrective actions, and explore delivery performance with interactive visualizations.

---

## Quick start (Windows)

1. Open PowerShell or Git Bash and go to project root:
   ```bash
   cd "d:/SEO consultant - Copy/Search-Engine-Optimization-Tool-main"
   ```

2. (If you don't have the venv) Create and activate a venv:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # PowerShell
   # or for cmd:
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if `requirements.txt` exists) or install minimal packages:
   ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   .venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   # If you face a missing package error (e.g., plotly), install manually:
   .venv\Scripts\python -m pip install plotly streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib
   ```

4. Run the app (recommended: use the venv Python so correct packages are used):
   ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\python -m streamlit run main.py
   ```
   To pick a specific port:
   ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\python -m streamlit run main.py --server.port 8501
   ```

---

## Purpose / What it does

- Loads and merges multiple CSV datasets (orders, delivery performance, routes, costs, fleet).
- Computes derived business metrics (Fuel_per_KM, Total_Cost_INR, Delay_Index, Reliability_Score, etc.).
- Trains/loads a delay prediction model and runs counterfactual simulations to estimate impact of interventions.
- Generates prioritized corrective actions with estimated delay reduction and (optional) CrewAI expansion.
- Interactive dashboard: scatter, histogram, pie, bar, line charts; filters; downloadable CSV exports.

---

## Data requirements

Place CSV files in the `data/` folder. Typical files and columns expected:
- `orders.csv` ‚Äî Order_ID, Order_Date, Route, Carrier, Priority, ...
- `delivery_performance.csv` ‚Äî Order_ID, Scheduled_Arrival, Actual_Arrival, Traffic_Delay_Minutes, Weather_Impact, ...
- `routes_distance.csv` ‚Äî Route, Distance_KM, Baseline_Time
- `cost_breakdown.csv` ‚Äî Order_ID/Route, Fuel_Cost_INR, Labor_Cost_INR, Maintenance_Cost_INR, Toll_Charges_INR
- `vehicle_fleet.csv` ‚Äî Vehicle_ID, Fuel_Efficiency, Capacity, Maintenance_History

If some columns are missing the app will use safe defaults (zero or NaN) and continue to run ‚Äî warnings will appear in the UI.

---

## Main features

- Predict delay for a hypothetical delivery via sidebar inputs.
- Generate prioritized corrective actions (re-route, schedule shift, fuel/vehicle optimization).
- Interactive visualizations (plotly): scatter, histogram, pie, bar, line (hover + zoom).
- Filters: Carrier, Weather, Priority, Date range ‚Äî dashboard updates dynamically.
- Export: Download filtered dataset and generated actions as CSV.
- CrewAI integration: optional ‚Äî set up credentials to enable richer action expansion. If unavailable, a local fallback is used.

---

## Recommended workflow

1. Ensure `data/` contains required CSVs.
2. Start app with the venv Python (see Quick start).
3. Use sidebar filters to narrow data; inspect charts and top delayed orders.
4. Use Predict Delay inputs to simulate scenarios and generate corrective actions.
5. Export filtered data and action plans for operational handoff.

---

## Environment notes & troubleshooting

- ModuleNotFoundError for `plotly` or other libs:
  - Ensure you run Streamlit with the venv Python:
    ```
    .venv\Scripts\python -m streamlit run main.py
    ```
  - Or install the missing package into the venv:
    ```
    .venv\Scripts\python -m pip install plotly
    ```

- If the app is served by a different Python (system) and you see missing modules, always use the `.venv\Scripts\python -m streamlit run ...` pattern.

- Port in use:
  - Use `--server.port <port>` to start on a free port.
  - To find processes using a port (PowerShell):
    ```powershell
    netstat -ano | findstr :8501
    tasklist /FI "PID eq <pid>"
    taskkill /PID <pid> /F
    ```

- To force the app to use the local Crew fallback (avoid external LLM attempts), set:
  - PowerShell:
    ```powershell
    $env:FORCE_LOCAL_CREW = '1'
    .venv\Scripts\python -m streamlit run main.py
    ```
  - Git Bash:
    ```bash
    export FORCE_LOCAL_CREW=1
    .venv/Scripts/python -m streamlit run main.py
    ```

---

## Code structure

- `main.py` ‚Äî Streamlit app and dashboard logic
- `utils/data_processing.py` ‚Äî data loading and merging (repo-relative paths)
- `utils/metrics.py` ‚Äî derived metric calculations and missing-data handling
- `predictor.py` ‚Äî model load/train wrapper and predict API
- `crew_setup.py` ‚Äî CrewAI creation helper with local fallback
- `data/` ‚Äî input CSVs (not included)

---

## Success & next steps

- Validate predictions on a held-out period.
- Run sensitivity simulations (multi-scenario) and export priorities.
- If desired, add a scheduled retraining pipeline and richer routing integrations.

---

If you want, I can:
- Add a sample-data generator for demos,
- Produce an installation script (PowerShell) that creates the venv and installs deps,
- Or produce a condensed `requirements-min.txt` for a smaller install.
